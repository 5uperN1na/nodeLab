I was a general service/lube technician for an auto repair chain around here. I was up and coming, trying to gain as much knowledge as possible, and trying to become a certified mechanic at the time. My job with this chain started at one location, and I loved it. The techs there did everything they could to teach me, to help me learn, and what I needed to add to my list of tools to buy. Now I was lucky. My dad was a retired mechanic, and had given me all of his tools. I had very nice equipment, all Snap-On, and all very expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to about 4 months into working here, and management told me that they were short handed at another location closer to my house, and they were going to transfer me to that shop instead. I wasn't happy with it, since I was learning so much where I was, but I obliged. The transfer went through a week later, and I started my first day at the shop from hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately there was a bad vibe there. Nobody got along with each other. The techs thought they were hot stuff and the lube guys didn't care enough about their job to learn anything. They all hated the management and service writers equally. That being said, my chance to learn my craft was severely hindered. Still though, I came in every day and gave it my all. That is, until one of the techs decided it would be funny to steal two of my wrenches, amounting to about $90. How did I know he stole them? Well, he told me. He thought it was funny to tell me he took them, then deny it up and down to management, but then when he and I were alone, he would demand a ransom if I wanted them back. Obviously on principle alone, I wasn't going to pay him a dime. Meanwhile he kept laughing and thinking he was the funniest guy in the world for several days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter several tries with both my direct management and the HR department, I wasn't getting anywhere at all. Nobody could prove he took anything, he denied it happened, and they refused to take any action. They definitely refused to replace my tools. It was time to take matters into my own hands. Being a shop that closed at 6, it was usually only myself and a service writer that stayed until closing, and everyone else, including the ass hole tech, left at 5. It was at closing time that my plan would be put into place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a particular day about 4 days later, it was closing time, everyone else but myself and the service writer had left. The service writer was working the front counter with a customer, and I was closing up the back shop. I shut everything down including the air compressor, but on this particular day I didn't let the 80 gallons of compressed air out of the tank. I then took one of the oil dispensers which was used for refilling the engine oil during a service, closed the cap and zip tied the handle open. The only thing keeping the dispenser from dumping oil was the cap being closed, but it was under the full pressure of the still aired up 80 gallon compressor. As we got wrapped up and hit 6:00, the writer and I were walking out the front door of the building getting ready to lock up. I jumped, told him I forgot something and had to run back into the shop real quick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got back there, I took my slide hammer which I had ready to use already and I popped the lock off of this technician's 3 bay Matco tool box. I grabbed the oil dispenser, popped the cap open, and propped it into the hole in the toolbox and then ran back outside. The service writer was none the wiser. As the alarm set and the door got locked, all 80 gallons of compressed air emptied the fresh motor oil into every orifice and drawer of his toolbox, onto the floor where he had boxes of clothes, and all over his work bays. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never came back to work after that, and about 2 weeks later corporate ended up sending me a check for the full replacement amount of my tools with an apology. I heard from someone else that worked there that he spent two full days cleaning up the mess but still had to replace some of his tools because he never could get all the oil out.

I had very nice equipment, all Snap-On, and all very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut to about 4 months into working here, and management told me that they were short handed at another location closer to my house, and they were going to transfer me to that shop instead. I wasn&amp;#39;t happy with it, since I was learning so much where I was, but I obliged. The transfer went through a week later, and I started my first day at the shop from hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately there was a bad vibe there. Nobody got along with each other. The techs thought they were hot stuff and the lube guys didn&amp;#39;t care enough about their job to learn anything. They all hated the management and service writers equally. That being said, my chance to learn my craft was severely hindered. Still though, I came in every day and gave it my all. That is, until one of the techs decided it would be funny to steal two of my wrenches, amounting to about $90. How did I know he stole them? Well, he told me. He thought it was funny to tell me he took them, then deny it up and down to management, but then when he and I were alone, he would demand a ransom if I wanted them back. Obviously on principle alone, I wasn&amp;#39;t going to pay him a dime. Meanwhile he kept laughing and thinking he was the funniest guy in the world for several days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After several tries with both my direct management and the HR department, I wasn&amp;#39;t getting anywhere at all. Nobody could prove he took anything, he denied it happened, and they refused to take any action. They definitely refused to replace my tools. It was time to take matters into my own hands. Being a shop that closed at 6, it was usually only myself and a service writer that stayed until closing, and everyone else, including the ass hole tech, left at 5. It was at closing time that my plan would be put into place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a particular day about 4 days later, it was closing time, everyone else but myself and the service writer had left. The service writer was working the front counter with a customer, and I was closing up the back shop. I shut everything down including the air compressor, but on this particular day I didn&amp;#39;t let the 80 gallons of compressed air out of the tank. I then took one of the oil dispensers which was used for refilling the engine oil during a service, closed the cap and zip tied the handle open. The only thing keeping the dispenser from dumping oil was the cap being closed, but it was under the full pressure of the still aired up 80 gallon compressor. As we got wrapped up and hit 6:00, the writer and I were walking out the front door of the building getting ready to lock up. I jumped, told him I forgot something and had to run back into the shop real quick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back there, I took my slide hammer which I had ready to use already and I popped the lock off of this technician&amp;#39;s 3 bay Matco tool box. I grabbed the oil dispenser, popped the cap open, and propped it into the hole in the toolbox and then ran back outside. The service writer was none the wiser. As the alarm set and the door got locked, all 80 gallons of compressed air emptied the fresh motor oil into every orifice and drawer of his toolbox, onto the floor where he had boxes of clothes, and all over his work bays. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never came back to work after that, and about 2 weeks later corporate ended up sending me a check for the full replacement amount of my tools with an apology. I heard from someone else that worked there that he spent two full days cleaning up the mess but still had to replace some of his tools because he never could get all the oil out. Was what I did harsh? Maybe. Don&amp;#39;t mess with a man&amp;#39;s tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjvl", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "a3f21x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Octane2100", "num_crossposts": 1, "num_comments": 168, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "house_only", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/ProRevenge/comments/a3f21x/steal_my_tools_ill_flood_your_toolbox/", "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/a3f21x/steal_my_tools_ill_flood_your_toolbox/", "subreddit_subscribers": 519275, "created_utc": 1544034592.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "europe", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_11hah5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Santa has updated his privacy policy.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/europe", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 95, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_a3ltva", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5222, "domain": "i.redd.it", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5222, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qx8lH908TwezYmRqh_FSKlrRUMcWsAu47gbjmItf4gs.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "image", "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1544110649.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=149809eeb063c144d88d86726b91149181e057ba", "width": 927, "height": 630}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc8f13118b6c811b08a320d417ec48086bb62fd9", "width": 108, "height": 73}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0ef9448687094141007cfe784e548bff305392f", "width": 216, "height": 146}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=243a7f269364a4b6c2e5db388074b180f1c755b2", "width": 320, "height": 217}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14f90d37875cc923e8d691a3109a6b31419e90a", "width": 640, "height": 434}], "variants": {}, "id": "7Bz3mo6y7yOyTYbW-e7QVt1ehU3Ig8ztVHax8GmBFnA"}], "enabled": true}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "a3ltva", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ManCrisp", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 58, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/a3ltva/santa_has_updated_his_privacy_policy/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://i.redd.it/6d6t7sxk2m221.jpg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1891605, "created_utc": 1544081849.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "selftext": "So girlfriend and I had just finished having sex.

And when I became nine years old, a family friend from Germany gave me a beautiful diary with a lock on it, knowing that I like keeping a diary. The diary came with two keys for the lock. After the kind lady who gave me the diary left, my parents demanded that I surrender one of the two keys to them. I refused. A few days later, one of the two keys disappeared. When I asked my parents about it, they became mad at me for suspecting them. They told me I must have been careless.\n\nFor the following weeks, I wrote my honest thoughts in the diary, sometimes complaining about my parents. Every time I finished writing, I carefully locked my diary. In the meantime, I also searched everywhere for the missing key but couldn't find it. One day, I came home after school and found my diary wide open on my desk. On every single used page of the diary, I found that my mom corrected my grammar and writing style in red pen. Also in a red pen and tiny handwriting, my mom disapproved of what I wrote about my parents, and she wrote long commentaries about why I am wrong. As I was flipping through the pages and feeling shocked, my parents told me to come out of my room because they have something important to talk about.\n\nThat night I got a beating from my dad. My parents said I left my diary open so they got to see what I wrote down. They said they were disappointed. I cried and promised them that I will never write anything bad about them. We came to some sort of an \"agreement.\": I will continue to write diaries every day, but at the end of each day I should bring my diary to be inspected by my mother so that she can check up on my \"grammar.\" They threw away my lock and its key, saying it's wrong to hide things away from people who truly care about me.\n\nFrom that day, I started to become extremely conscious about what I write, and started to feel anxiety. Every time I wrote something in my diary, I constantly thought about what will people think if they read this. Being conscious about the implication of my writing isn't a bad habit, but it made me hide my true thoughts and emotions. And every time I wrote or drew something on a piece of paper, I destroyed it immediately afterwards, because I was scared my mom might see it. A couple of years later, I stopped writing and drawing on diaries.\n\nThere was just one time I started writing diaries again, but it didn't last long. One day I came home to find my mom in my room, reading over my diary. I asked her to put it down, and she yelled at me, saying that I shouldn't treat her like a stranger. So I stopped using that diary and began writing on my laptop. But my parents had the habit of coming into my room without knocking (they still do that now). They would often come into my room, stare at my screen, and read my writings aloud. If they find it funny, they would yell at their partner to come inside and take a look, so that they can laugh at it together. So I stopped the activity of journaling and writing entirely.\n\nTen years passed, and a week ago I found one of the keys to my diary in a small drawer where we keep all our keys. I showed it my parents and asked why they lied to me about the key when one of them went missing. They got mad. They told me they just found the key recently and put it in the drawer. I didn't believe them. I also didn't believe them back when they told me that I left my diary open.\n\nAnd yesterday I was trying to remember something from earlier this year. My mom walked by, tutted and told me that I would have remembered it had I just kept writing diaries. I got extremely angry, but there was nothing I could do. Trying to talking with my mom will only make things worse because she does not want to be in the position of being criticized. Thanks to her and her stupid sidekick husband, now I am terrified of writing anything physically on paper, and now my hands are shaking as I'm writing this. I could never share this story with anyone, and I don't have many friends who are close enough to hear this story. Writing this somewhat made me calm down, but I will never forgive them for crippling my ability to write diaries and remember my past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you so much for giving me your kind words and encouragement, sharing your stories with me, and for gilding me.

And when I became nine years old, a family friend from Germany gave me a beautiful diary with a lock on it, knowing that I like keeping a diary. The diary came with two keys for the lock. After the kind lady who gave me the diary left, my parents demanded that I surrender one of the two keys to them. I refused. A few days later, one of the two keys disappeared. When I asked my parents about it, they became mad at me for suspecting them. They told me I must have been careless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the following weeks, I wrote my honest thoughts in the diary, sometimes complaining about my parents. Every time I finished writing, I carefully locked my diary. In the meantime, I also searched everywhere for the missing key but couldn&amp;#39;t find it. One day, I came home after school and found my diary wide open on my desk. On every single used page of the diary, I found that my mom corrected my grammar and writing style in red pen. Also in a red pen and tiny handwriting, my mom disapproved of what I wrote about my parents, and she wrote long commentaries about why I am wrong. As I was flipping through the pages and feeling shocked, my parents told me to come out of my room because they have something important to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night I got a beating from my dad. My parents said I left my diary open so they got to see what I wrote down. They said they were disappointed. I cried and promised them that I will never write anything bad about them.

I was a part-timer, working 9 hours per week: 3pm-9pm on Saturdays, and 1pm-4pm on Sundays. Part of my job was to close down the department on both days, because none of the managers liked being around at closing time. The department closed at 9pm on Saturdays but it was often about 9:20 that I actually left. Closing down a department takes time, mostly because you can't do it when customers are browsing. Unsurprisingly, I consistently worked more hours than I was supposed to.\n\nAll store employees were on the clock, and for some reason the store took readings down to the second. You were paid an hourly rate to within a few seconds of how long you were clocked in for.\n\nMy manager (I'll call her Val, because that was her name) called a meeting at 3pm on a Saturday, which coincidentally was the time I was scheduled to start work. Everyone in the department was either starting or finishing their shifts within a couple of hours of then, so it was a logical time, but that was about the only logical thing about it.\n\nThe thrust of the meeting was that \"some people\" - she said, looking directly at me down the length of her not-inconsiderable nose - were claiming more than their allotted hours, and that this must stop. Henceforth, all overtime must be approved in writing. This was entirely her decision. Other departments didn't have this problem as long as you weren't taking the mick.\n\nFast forward to about 8:45pm. Val and I were the only employees left in the department. She started to gather her things, as is her way. And I started the process of putting our more expensive frames into their night display cases, where they could safely be locked away when the department was closed.\n\n\n**Val**: What on Earth are you doing, ThereShallBeWings?\n\n**Me**: I'm locking up. I have to make sure I don't go over my hours today.\n\n**Val**: This department has to be open until 9pm. It's in the store handbook. You can't lock up right now, my boss will be furious.\n\n**Me**: You know from experience that it takes a good 10 minutes (I lied, it's actually more like 20) to lock up. I'm not allowed to be on the premises after I clock out. I have to start locking up otherwise I'll be disciplined.\n\n\nI reached for the tannoy and my voice saying \"Good evening. Would Mrs Lock please come to the optical department? Mrs Lock to the optical department. Thank you!\" resonated through the store - code for \"Security, bring the keys, we're locking up\". Val goes white as a sheet. The first cracks in her caked-on makeup began to show, I could see the look on her snooty face as a very large penny began to drop. She yelled \"Wait here!\" while leaving the department with a purposeful stride.\n\nBy the time she'd returned, I'd explained to the security guard, what's happening. He agreed to play along. We start (slowly) locking down the spectacle frames.\n\nVal, with sweat starting to show on her brow, wordlessly handed me a hastily-scribbled note authorising 30 minutes of overtime. I showed it to the security guard, who nodded. Val left without a word, looking really flustered, just as a customer walked in. My friend from security unlocked the frames again and I went to serve.\n\nThe following day, Val's usual snooty demeanour had changed. She didn't look contrite, but there were definitely a few cracks in her expression. She took me to one side, and without preamble, handed me a new rota, and launched into what was clearly a well-rehearsed speech.\n\n\n**Val**: ThereShallBeWings, I have approved your request to extend your hours to 10 hours a week. I now expect you to work from 4pm until 9:30pm on Saturdays, and from 1pm until 4:30pm on Sundays. I trust that this will not be a problem?\n\n**Me**: Oh, that's fine, thank you Val.\n\n**Val**: And henceforth, if you should happen to work slightly over your hours, do not be overly concerned about it.\n\n\nTL;DR: Stuck-up boss announces an overtime ban, not realising the overtime was me closing down the department after the close of trading.
